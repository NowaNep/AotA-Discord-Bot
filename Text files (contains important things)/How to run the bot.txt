(FIRST TIME ONLY) https://nodejs.org/en/ <- download node.js it is used to run the bot. NPM is also needed to run the bot.

to check if you have it. try running "node -v" first.
If you do not have it. run "npm install -g npm" this should have everything you need.


To run the bot first have the console up in vscode (Ctrl + ` <- the thing on the top left of the keeb)

Make sure you are on the terminal part of the console

(FIRST TIME ONLY UNLESS WE ADD A PACKAGE INTO THE CODE) Type "npm install" to get all the node modules needed to run the bot

Type "node index.js" to run the bot. if not let me (nep) know

deploy-commands.js is a way to add the commands to the server.
The config.json i gave you should be the AotA server id

if any questions tell nepnep !
